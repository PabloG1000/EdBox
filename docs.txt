 how to create responsive designs using media query, grid, flexbox , bootstrap
 and tailwind
       breakpoint
@media (max-width:600px){
    props
}
Or @media (min-width:600px){

}
or @media max-width(max-width:1000px) and (min-width:800px)

 u can also use grid
 grid has differnent properties such as row and column 
 to ceate the number of colums you take the root div that is the house
 and you give it a css proprty called grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr ...
 repeat(8, 80px);
 use this instead for boh rows and columns
                                                             This stand for the number of colums with their respective width
                                      grid-template-row: 100px 200px 200px 
                                      basically the diffent number of rows with their respective heights   
                                      gap: 30px ; this to give spacing between the elements that is the differnt divs
                                      grid-column: span 2; this to state the amount of column width it will occupy


bootstrap framework
it's built on top of flexbox

widths of devices to create responsive designs
small phones  320px to 360px
regular 375px to 414px
large 480px
max width: 480px;


tablet
portrait 600px to 768px
landscape: 800px to 1024px
breakpoint:768px

laptops:
small 1024px 1280px
most 1366px to 1440px
breakpoint : min-width 1024px

monitor

flexbox elements adapt auytomatically but  no precise control
best for smaller components,nvbars,aligning items or when only one direction is needed

grid full control of rows and colums
best for full page layout , dashboards,galleries, anything that nedecds a structured row and column system

your colors must match the mood you're aiming for
RED: love, emergy, Intensity
Yellow:Joy, Intellect,Attention
Green: Freshness,Safety,Growth
blue: stability,trust, serenity
purple: royalty, wealth, feminity

combining colors
Analogous colors:take two colors that are right next to each other in the color wheel
good for navigation bar, body of your website
bad at standing out

Complimentary color palette : opp colors
to stand out
don't use it for text
